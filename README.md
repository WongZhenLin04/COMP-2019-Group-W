## Emotion Recognition Based on Brain-Computer Interface Systems
This project involves developing an Artificial Intelligence (AI) model using a Deep Learning algorithm for emotion recognition. Using Tenserflow, our Deep neural network (DNN) model has an accuracy of 0.77 (77%). The predicted emotions (positive, neutral or negative) are displayed on a dashboard using Plotly Dash.

Features: 
1. Reading and preprocessing raw EEG data stored in .mat files
2. Epoching data into 1-second segments
3. Feature selection
4. Feature extraction 
5. Training a Deep Learning model using Tensorflow
6. Displaying identified emotions on a dashboard
